Top 10 Machine Learning Algorithms(2023)

## Linear regression
   
- Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting and forecasting values that fall within a continuous range, such as sales numbers or housing prices.
- It is a technique derived from statistics and is commonly used to establish a relationship between an
input variable (X) and an output variable (Y) that can be represented by a straight line.
- In simple terms, linear regression takes a set of data points with known input and output
values and finds the line that best fits those points. This line, known as the "regression line,"
serves as a predictive model. By using this line, we can estimate or predict the output value (Y) for a given input value (X).
- Linear regression is primarily used for predictive modeling rather than categorization.
- It is useful when we want to understand how changes in the input variable affect the output variable.
- By analyzing the slope and intercept of the regression line, we can gain insights into the relationship between the variables and make predictions based on this understanding.

## Logistic Regression

- Logistic regression, also known as "logit regression," is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks. 
- It is commonly employed when we want to determine whether an input belongs to one class or another, such as deciding whether an image is a cat or not a cat. 

- Logistic regression predicts the probability that an input can be categorized into a single primary class. 
- However, in practice, it is commonly used to group outputs into two categories: the primary class and not the primary class. 
- To accomplish this, logistic regression creates a threshold or boundary for binary classification. 
- For example, any output value between 0 and 0.49 might be classified as one group, while values between 0.50 and 1.00 would be classified as the other group. 

- Consequently, logistic regression is typically used for binary categorization rather than predictive modeling. 
- It enables us to assign input data to one of two classes based on the probability estimate and a defined threshold. 
- This makes logistic regression a powerful tool for tasks such as image recognition, spam email detection, or medical diagnosis where we need to categorize data into distinct classes.
